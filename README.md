# Laptop Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the prices of laptops based on various features such as screen size, processor type, GPU, SSD, and more. The goal is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a laptop given these features.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains information about various laptops with the following key features:
- **Brand**
- **Model**
- **Screen Size**
- **Processor Type (CPU)**
- **Graphics Card (GPU)**
- **Storage (SSD/HDD)**
- **RAM**
- **Operating System**
- **Price** (target variable)

## Project Goals
1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove or impute missing values, and handle any inconsistencies in the dataset.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Transform categorical data, scale numeric features, and create any additional features that might improve model performance.
3. **Model Building**: Train a variety of machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) to predict laptop prices.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Compare models using performance metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: For data manipulation and machine learning.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Flask**: For deploying the model as a web app.

## Key Features
- Price prediction of laptops based on multiple hardware and software specifications.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns in the laptop market.
- A user-friendly Flask web app for easy interaction with the model.
